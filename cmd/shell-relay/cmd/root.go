Three services required in total for a single connection:
  host: the unattended remote machine 
  client: the attended local machine 
  relay: runs at a public IP address, shared out of band with the host and client

A relay can handle multiple connections. An administrator with multiple hosts to access, 
should start a separate client instance for each host they wish to connect to.
