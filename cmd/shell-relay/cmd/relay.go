It is expected that you will reverse proxy incoming connections (e.g. with nginx or apache). 
No provision is made for handling TLS in shell relay because this is more convenient
than separately managing certificates, especially when load balancing as may be required.
Note that load balancing takes place at the access phase, with the subsequent connection
being made by the associated relay. The FQDN of your relay access points must be distinct,
so that this affinity is maintained. The FQDN of the access points on the other hand, must
be the same, so that load balancing can be applied in your reverse proxy. All connections 
are individual so connections to a particular host can be simultaneously made in different 
shell relay instances, so long as the relay connection is made in the same instance which
handled the access (see comment above on setting target FQDN to be distinct, so that 
websocket connections are reverse proxied to the correct instance).
